## Status
### Data Normalization Model
Currently is able to take uploaded CSV file and convert into an array of JSON objects for each line of the log.
Further work needs to be put into error handling and verification of correct fields. Model should also be cleaned up/split into different components.
### UI/UX
Basically nonexistant...

Currently is just the Vue homepage with the input component beneath it. All output is through the console.
